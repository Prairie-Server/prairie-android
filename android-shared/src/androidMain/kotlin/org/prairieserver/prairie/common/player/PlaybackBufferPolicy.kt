         * the buffer drains below minBufferMs — so the gap between them is
         * literally how long the connection sits idle, in the player's media
         * clock. Upstream proxies close an idle response body based on WALL
         * CLOCK time: nginx's send_timeout defaults to 60s. The old
         * hand-written 50s/120s pair left a 70s gap and dropped the connection
         * every time the buffer filled on a long direct-play file.
         *
         * Those two clocks only agree at 1.0x. DefaultLoadControl scales
         * minBufferUs for speeds ABOVE 1.0, but not below it, and the UI
         * offers rates down to [SLOWEST_PLAYBACK_SPEED] (0.5x, see
         * SPEED_PRESETS in TvAudiobookSpeedPanel.kt and the clamp in
         * AudiobookSpeedSheet.kt) for audiobooks, which share this load
         * control. At 0.5x, one media-time second of idle window takes two
         * wall-clock seconds to elapse — so a naive 30s media-time window
         * becomes 60s of wall clock, exactly nginx's default send_timeout,
         * with zero margin.
         *
         * 15_000 is that same 30s wall-clock budget scaled down by the
         * slowest rate (30_000 * SLOWEST_PLAYBACK_SPEED = 15_000): at 0.5x it
         * stretches back out to 30s of wall clock, half of
         * ASSUMED_PROXY_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS, so the window holds at every speed
         * the UI offers, not just 1.0x.
         *
         * maxBufferMs is therefore never written by hand; it is always
         * minBufferMs + this. Depth can grow without ever widening the window.
