 * Right-aligned full-screen overlay panel over a dimming scrim, shared by the

 * not phone bottom sheets). Back is handled by the host screen.
 *
 * Acquisition lives here rather than in each panel because every panel needs it
 * and the ones that hand-rolled it got it wrong in the same way: a single
 * unobserved `requestFocus()`, some of them fired before the target row had
 * been laid out. A rejected request was indistinguishable from a successful
 * one, so the panel opened with focus still on the transport pill behind the
 * scrim — and the containment below cannot help with focus that never entered.
 *
 * [initialFocus] is required, not optional: a panel with nothing focusable in
 * it cannot own focus, and while it is open the covered player is suppressed,
 * so "no focus target" means a dead D-pad rather than a cosmetic problem.
 *
 * [onAcquisitionFailed] is the escape hatch for when that still does not work.
 * Acquisition is retried until observed, but "retried until observed" is not
 * the same as "guaranteed", and the shared dialog adapter's last resort — ask
 * the focus system to enter the overlay by traversal — returns a Boolean that
 * can be false, with nothing left to try. Suppressing the player behind an
 * overlay that then fails to take focus is strictly worse than the escape bug
 * this replaces, so the failure is reported instead of swallowed and the host
 * hands the player back.
